# WordPress-Functions
Collection of regularily used code snippets for WordPress to enhance both the front end and dashboard.

1. Replace the Howdy greeting in the Dashboard - replace-howdy.php
When I first started developing WordPress themes, the moment my Client would enter the Dashboard they would instantly say. "Can we change the Howdy to something else?" Finally i started adding this snippet and the issue was resolved.

2. Brand The Dashboard Admin Footer - Dashboard-footer.php
When developing a WordPress website for a client I always add this snippet.
